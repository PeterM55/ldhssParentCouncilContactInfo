# ldhssParentCouncilContactInfo
this was a program made in 2018 and it was made to save information for taking in information from those coming into parent council. It works, but it was unfinished.

At the time I didn't know how to check file so I saved them using a random number between 1 and 10,000. so the odds of it overriding was small, but that is obviously still a bad way to make it. And if it was deemed necisary the number could be increased to 100,000 or even 1,000,000,000
I had planned to fix it and make it work better and do more bug testing, but I decided to drop the project for a java version.
